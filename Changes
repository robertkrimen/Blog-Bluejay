TODO:
    - Make sure all dependencies are up-to-date on CPAN
    - Getopt::Long parsing on 'blog-blue server', fastcgi, etc.

FUTURE:
    - Upgrade strategy:
        Blog::Bluejay::Upgrade
        Blog::Bluejay::Upgrade::App
            backup/copy
            upgrade (on copy)
            test (on copy)
            commit (move copy to production)
        Blog::Bluejay::Upgrade::v3::From::{v1,v2}
        ~/t/upgrade/v3/*.t
        New schema table: schema_version (use DBIx::Class::Versioned for this?)
